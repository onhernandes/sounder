# SoundMan - YouTube Song API

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This was mainly written with ExpressJS + MongoDB, but I've refactored to KoaJS + Sequelize with MySQL because I wanted to. Initially, you could download songs from youtube, but now you actually can't because my main focus was to just write an API. This isn't perfect, there's a lot that can be improved, including writing some tests and documenting the API, and actually writing a script to download songs.

Stay safe.
